# Yet another RSA implementation

Note: you should have [NTL library](https://libntl.org/doc/tour-unix.html) installed on your machine.

## Usage

You should change the input.txt file as below and observe the output.txt for the result. The program takes in the number of bits of prime and generate the 2 primes, which are then used to create RSA.

### Input file contains 1 lines:
    number of bits of prime number

### Run code
    $ make all

### Output file contains 4 lines:
    first prime number
    first prime number
    public key
    private key
